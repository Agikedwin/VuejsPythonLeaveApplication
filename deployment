Heh, yes I ran into the same problem myself today. Most of the issues are due to OS-level dependencies required by the cryptography module. I found that the following resolved all those dependencies for me (on Ubuntu 14.04 trusty 64 bit):

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install libffi-dev g++ libssl-dev

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON leave_system.* TO 'root'@'41.89.200.55' IDENTIFIED BY 'test12' WITH GRANT OPTION;

NGINX FILE::::::
/etc/nginx/sites-available/leaveap

start 9 walkers
gunicorn -w 9 run:app (in server dir)

INSTALL SUPERVISOR 

sudo apt install supervisor 


##########################MYSQL##########################
Edit the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file with your favorite text editor after log in.
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf      # On the server

 
Search for the line bind-address and change it to 0.0.0.0 from 127.0.0.1, then save and exit the editor. Tip: Use the Ctrl + w shortcut with nano to easily find the line.
Restart the mysql server, either with systemd or use the older service command.
